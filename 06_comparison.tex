\chapter{Compare TMS-EEG and F-TRACT results}\label{ch:compare}



\section{Parcellations mapping}

Direct comparison of the TMS-EEG and F-TRACT results is not possible, because they do not share brain parcellation. The TMS-EEG dataset is published in Schaefer200 parcellation, which is not available for F-TRACT. Because of that, it is necessary to find a mapping between Glasser and Schaefer200 parcellation.

% Even though Biabani et al. \cite{biabani_characterizing_2019} declare they stimulated the primary motor cortex, the source-reconstruction of the TMS-EEG data by Momi et al. \cite{momi_tms-evoked_2023} suggest the stimulation of slightly different site, specifically L\_3b. This is further explained in Section \ref{sec:parcellations-mapping-stimulated_roi}.
