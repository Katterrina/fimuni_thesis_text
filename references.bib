	abstract = {Nowadays, connectivity patterns of brain networks are of special interest, as they may reflect communication in the brain at the structural and functional levels. Their extraction, however, is a complex process that requires deep knowledge of magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) data processing methods. Furthermore, there is no consensus as to which parcellation of the brain is most suitable for a given analysis. Therefore, 19 different state-of-the-art cortical parcellations were used in this dataset to reconstruct the region-based empirical structural connectivity (representing the anatomy of axonal tracts) and functional connectivity (representing the temporal correlation between neuronal activity of brain regions) from diffusion-weighted ({dwMRI}) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) data, respectively. The repository provides individual connectomes for 200 subjects from the Human Connectome Project. The data can be used by members of the neuroimaging community to investigate structural and functional human connectomes, and to extend the investigation to whole-brain models for further analyses of brain structure and function.},

This review summarizes the data acquisition plans being implemented by a consortium of {HCP} investigators who will study a population of 1200 subjects (twins and their non-twin siblings) using multiple imaging modalities along with extensive behavioral and genetic data. The imaging modalities will include diffusion imaging ({dMRI}), resting-state {fMRI} (R-{fMRI}), task-evoked {fMRI} (T-{fMRI}), T1- and T2-weighted {MRI} for structural and myelin mapping, plus combined magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography ({MEG}/{EEG}). Given the importance of obtaining the best possible data quality, we discuss the efforts underway during the first two years of the grant (Phase I) to refine and optimize many aspects of {HCP} data acquisition, including a new 7T scanner, a customized 3T scanner, and improved {MR} pulse sequences.},

Since its inception, tens of thousands of studies using techniques such as functional {MRI} and diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive study of the brain. Despite the fact that {MRI} is routinely used to obtain data for neuroscience research, there has been no widely adopted standard for organizing and describing the data collected in an imaging experiment. This renders sharing and reusing data (within or between labs) difficult if not impossible and unnecessarily complicates the application of automatic pipelines and quality assurance protocols. To solve this problem, we have developed the Brain Imaging Data Structure ({BIDS}), a standard for organizing and describing {MRI} datasets. The {BIDS} standard uses file formats compatible with existing software, unifies the majority of practices already common in the field, and captures the metadata necessary for most common data processing operations.},

	abstract = {A central goal in systems neuroscience is the parcellation of the cerebral cortex into discrete neurobiological “atoms”. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-{fMRI}) offers the possibility of in vivo human cortical parcellation. Almost all previous parcellations relied on 1 of 2 approaches. The local gradient approach detects abrupt transitions in functional connectivity patterns. These transitions potentially reflect cortical areal boundaries defined by histology or visuotopic {fMRI}. By contrast, the global similarity approach clusters similar functional connectivity patterns regardless of spatial proximity, resulting in parcels with homogeneous (similar) rs-{fMRI} signals. Here, we propose a gradient-weighted Markov Random Field ({gwMRF}) model integrating local gradient and global similarity approaches. Using task-{fMRI} and rs-{fMRI} across diverse acquisition protocols, we found {gwMRF} parcellations to be more homogeneous than 4 previously published parcellations. Furthermore, {gwMRF} parcellations agreed with the boundaries of certain cortical areas defined using histology and visuotopic {fMRI}. Some parcels captured subareal (somatotopic and visuotopic) features that likely reflect distinct computational units within known cortical areas. These results suggest that {gwMRF} parcellations reveal neurobiologically meaningful features of brain organization and are potentially useful for future applications requiring dimensionality reduction of voxel-wise {fMRI} data. Multiresolution parcellations generated from 1489 participants are publicly available (https://github.com/{ThomasYeoLab}/{CBIG}/tree/master/stable\_projects/brain\_parcellation/Schaefer2018\_LocalGlobal).},

	abstract = {Information processing in the cerebral cortex involves interactions among distributed areas. Anatomical connectivity suggests that certain areas form local hierarchical relations such as within the visual system. Other connectivity patterns, particularly among association areas, suggest the presence of large-scale circuits without clear hierarchical relations. In this study the organization of networks in the human cerebrum was explored using resting-state functional connectivity {MRI}. Data from 1,000 subjects were registered using surface-based alignment. A clustering approach was employed to identify and replicate networks of functionally coupled regions across the cerebral cortex. The results revealed local networks confined to sensory and motor cortices as well as distributed networks of association regions. Within the sensory and motor cortices, functional connectivity followed topographic representations across adjacent areas. In association cortex, the connectivity patterns often showed abrupt transitions between network boundaries. Focused analyses were performed to better understand properties of network connectivity. A canonical sensory-motor pathway involving primary visual area, putative middle temporal area complex ({MT}+), lateral intraparietal area, and frontal eye field was analyzed to explore how interactions might arise within and between networks. Results showed that adjacent regions of the {MT}+ complex demonstrate differential connectivity consistent with a hierarchical pathway that spans networks. The functional connectivity of parietal and prefrontal association cortices was next explored. Distinct connectivity profiles of neighboring regions suggest they participate in distributed networks that, while showing evidence for interactions, are embedded within largely parallel, interdigitated circuits. We conclude by discussing the organization of these large-scale cerebral networks in relation to monkey anatomy and their potential evolutionary expansion in humans to support cognition.},

	abstract = {Understanding the amazingly complex human cerebral cortex requires a map (or parcellation) of its major subdivisions, known as cortical areas. Making an accurate areal map has been a century-old objective in neuroscience. Using multi-modal magnetic resonance images from the Human Connectome Project ({HCP}) and an objective semi-automated neuroanatomical approach, we delineated 180 areas per hemisphere bounded by sharp changes in cortical architecture, function, connectivity, and/or topography in a precisely aligned group average of 210 healthy young adults. We characterized 97 new areas and 83 areas previously reported using post-mortem microscopy or other specialized study-specific approaches. To enable automated delineation and identification of these areas in new {HCP} subjects and in future studies, we trained a machine-learning classifier to recognize the multi-modal ‘fingerprint’ of each cortical area. This classifier detected the presence of 96.6\% of the cortical areas in new subjects, replicated the group parcellation, and could correctly locate areas in individuals with atypical parcellations. The freely available parcellation and classifier will enable substantially improved neuroanatomical precision for studies of the structural and functional organization of human cerebral cortex and its variation across individuals and in development, aging, and disease.},

The “Desikan–Killiany–Tourville” ({DKT}) protocol is intended to improve the ease, consistency, and accuracy of labeling human cortical areas. Given how difﬁcult it is to label brains, the Mindboggle-101 dataset is intended to serve as brain atlases for use in labeling other brains, as a normative dataset to establish morphometric variation in a healthy population for comparison against clinical populations, and contribute to the development, training, testing, and evaluation of automated registration and labeling algorithms. To this end, we also introduce benchmarks for the evaluation of such algorithms by comparing our manual labels with labels automatically generated by probabilistic and multi-atlas registration-based approaches.

	abstract = {There are different techniques for recording human brain activity. One of them {EEG} can capture brain activity in the time frame at which the activity occurs, but has a poor spatial resolution. Another technology {fMRI}, captures brain activity with high spatial resolution compared to {EEG}, but with poor temporal resolution. Simultaneously recording brain activity using these two techniques helps us capture a richer, spatio-temporally more precise description of human brain activity. Inferring the source location within the brain from an {EEG} signal is deﬁned as {EEG} source localization problem. In this thesis, a new method that is based on machine learning for solving {EEG} source localization problem is proposed and its performance is evaluated on a simultaneously recorded {EEG} and {fMRI} data set. This method’s performance is also compared to a commonly used method.},

	abstract = {The electroencephalogram ({EEG}) is one of the oldest technologies to measure neuronal activity of the human brain. It has its undisputed value in clinical diagnosis, particularly (but not exclusively) in the identiﬁcation of epilepsy and sleep disorders and in the evaluation of dysfunctions in sensory transmission pathways. With the advancement of digital technologies, the analysis of {EEG} has moved from pure visual inspection of amplitude and frequency modulations over time to a comprehensive exploration of the temporal and spatial characteristics of the recorded signals. Today, {EEG} is accepted as a powerful tool to capture brain function with the unique advantage of measuring neuronal processes in the time frame in which these processes occur, namely in the sub-second range. However, it is generally stated that {EEG} suffers from a poor spatial resolution that makes it difﬁcult to infer to the location of the brain areas generating the neuronal activity measured on the scalp. This statement has challenged a whole community of biomedical engineers to offer solutions to localize more precisely and more reliably the generators of the {EEG} activity. High-density {EEG} systems combined with precise information of the head anatomy and sophisticated source localization algorithms now exist that convert the {EEG} to a true neuroimaging modality. With these tools in hand and with the fact that {EEG} still remains versatile, inexpensive and portable, electrical neuroimaging has become a widely used technology to study the functions of the pathological and healthy human brain. However, several steps are needed to pass from the recording of the {EEG} to 3-dimensional images of neuronal activity. This review explains these different steps and illustrates them in a comprehensive analysis pipeline integrated in a stand-alone freely available academic software: Cartool. The information about how the different steps are performed in Cartool is only meant as a suggestion. Other {EEG} source imaging software may apply similar or different approaches to the different steps.},

We present material at the cutting edge of neuroscience in a way that is accessible to both science and nonscience students alike.

The book is divided into four parts: Part I, Foundations; Part {II}, Sensory and Motor Systems; Part {III}, The Brain and Behavior; and Part {IV}, The Changing Brain. We begin Part I by introducing the modern field of neuroscience and tracing some of its historical antecedents. Then we take a close look at the structure and function of individual neurons, how they communicate chemically, and how these building blocks are arranged to form a nervous system. In Part {II}, we go inside the brain to examine the structure and function of the systems that serve the senses and command voluntary movements. In Part {III}, we explore the neurobiology of human behavior, including motivation, sex, emotion, sleep, language, attention, and mental illness. Finally, in Part {IV}, we look at how the environment modifies the brain, both during development and in adult learning and memory"--Provided by publisher},

While the planned scope of the {HCP} included an anatomic connectome, resting-state {fMRI} (rs-{fMRI}) forms the bulk of the {HCP}’s current connectomic output. We address this by presenting a fullcortex connectome derived from probabilistic diffusion tractography and organized into the {HCP}-{MMP}1.0 atlas. Probabilistic methods and large sample sizes are preferable for whole-connectome mapping as they increase the fidelity of traced low-probability connections. We find that overall, connection strengths are lognormally distributed and decay exponentially with tract length, that connectivity reasonably matches macaque histologic tracing in homologous areas, that contralateral homologs and left-lateralized language areas are hyperconnected, and that hierarchical similarity influences connectivity. We compare the {dMRI} connectome to existing rs-{fMRI} and cortico-cortico-evoked potential connectivity matrices and find that it is more similar to the latter. This work helps fulfill the promise of the {HCP} and will make possible comparisons between the underlying structural connectome and functional connectomes of various modalities, brain states, and clinical conditions.},

Median connectivity is estimated as approximately 6,200 axons between cortical areas within hemisphere and approximately 1,300 axons interhemispherically, with axons connecting functionally related areas surprisingly sparse. For example, we estimate that {\textless}5\% of the axons in the trunk of the arcuate and superior longitudinal fasciculi connect Wernicke’s and Broca’s areas.

            Multimodal neuroimaging grants a powerful window into the structure and function of the human brain at multiple scales. Recent methodological and conceptual advances have enabled investigations of the interplay between large-scale spatial trends (also referred to as gradients) in brain microstructure and connectivity, offering an integrative framework to study multiscale brain organization. Here, we share a multimodal {MRI} dataset for Microstructure-Informed Connectomics ({MICA}-{MICs}) acquired in 50 healthy adults (23 women; 29.54±5.62 years) who underwent high-resolution T1-weighted {MRI}, myelin-sensitive quantitative T1 relaxometry, diffusion-weighted {MRI}, and resting-state functional {MRI} at 3 Tesla. In addition to raw anonymized {MRI} data, this release includes brain-wide connectomes derived from i) resting-state functional imaging, ii) diffusion tractography, iii) microstructure covariance analysis, and iv) geodesic cortical distance, gathered across multiple parcellation scales. Alongside, we share large-scale gradients estimated from each modality and parcellation scale. Our dataset will facilitate future research examining the coupling between brain microstructure, connectivity, and macroscale function. {MICA}-{MICs} is available on the Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform’s data portal (

Electroencephalography ({EEG}) provides temporal resolution in the millisecond range. However, traditional {EEG} technology and practice provide insufficient spatial detail to identify relationships between brain electrical events and structures and functions visualized by magnetic resonance imaging or positron emission tomography. Recent advances help to overcome this problem by recording {EEGs} from more electrodes, by registering {EEG} data with anatomical images, and by correcting the distortion caused by volume conduction of {EEG} signals through the skull and scalp. In addition, statistical measurements of sub-second interdependences between {EEG} time-series recorded from different locations can help to generate hypotheses about the instantaneous functional networks that form between different cortical regions during perception, thought and action. Example applications are presented from studies of language, attention and working memory. Along with its unique ability to monitor brain function as people perform everyday activities in the real world, these advances make modern {EEG} an invaluable complement to other functional neuroimaging modalities.},

We then consider how different local and global topological attributes of structural networks support potential patterns of network communication, and how the interactions between network topology and dynamic models can provide additional insights and constraints. We end by proposing that communication dynamics may act as potential generative models of effective connectivity and can offer insight into the mechanisms by which brain networks transform and process information.},

	abstract = {Background: The Perturbational Complexity Index ({PCI}) was recently introduced to assess the capacity of thalamocortical circuits to engage in complex patterns of causal interactions. While showing high accuracy in detecting consciousness in brain-injured patients, {PCI} depends on elaborate experimental setups and ofﬂine processing, and has restricted applicability to other types of brain signals beyond transcranial magnetic stimulation and high-density {EEG} ({TMS}/hd-{EEG}) recordings.
Objective: We aim to address these limitations by introducing {PCIST}, a fast method for estimating perturbational complexity of any given brain response signal.
Methods: {PCIST} is based on dimensionality reduction and state transitions ({ST}) quantiﬁcation of evoked potentials. The index was validated on a large dataset of {TMS}/hd-{EEG} recordings obtained from 108 healthy subjects and 108 brain-injured patients, and tested on sparse intracranial recordings ({SEEG}) of 9 patients undergoing intracranial single-pulse electrical stimulation ({SPES}) during wakefulness and sleep.
Results: When calculated on {TMS}/hd-{EEG} potentials, {PCIST} performed with the same accuracy as the original {PCI}, while improving on the previous method by being computed in less than a second and requiring a simpler set-up. In {SPES}/{SEEG} signals, the index was able to quantify a systematic reduction of intracranial complexity during sleep, conﬁrming the occurrence of state-dependent changes in the effective connectivity of thalamocortical circuits, as originally assessed through {TMS}/hd-{EEG}.
Conclusions: {PCIST} represents a fundamental advancement towards the implementation of a reliable and fast clinical tool for the bedside assessment of consciousness as well as a general measure to explore the neuronal mechanisms of loss/recovery of brain complexity across scales and models.},

The utility of graph theory—a powerful mathematical approach for modeling complex network systems—for analyzing tractography‐based connectomes brings important opportunities to interrogate connectome data, providing novel insights into the connectivity patterns and topological characteristics of brain structural networks. When applying this framework, however, there are challenges, particularly regarding methodological and biological plausibility. This article describes the challenges surrounding quantitative tractography and potential solutions.

Therefore, a thorough anatomical reference for the analysis and interpretation of connectome data is indispensable to understand the structure and function of different regions of the cortex, the white matter fibre architecture connecting them, and the interplay between these different entities. This article focuses on parcellation schemes of the cerebral grey matter and their relevance for connectome analyses. In particular, benefits and limitations of using different available atlases and parcellation schemes are reviewed. It is furthermore discussed how atlas information is currently used in connectivity analyses with major focus on seed-based and seed-target analyses, connectivity-based parcellation results, and the robust anatomical interpretation of connectivity data. Particularly this last aspect opens the possibility of integrating connectivity information into given anatomical frameworks, paving the way to multi-modal atlases of the human brain for a thorough understanding of structure-function relationships.},

              Using brain atlases to localize regions of interest is a requirement for making neuroscientifically valid statistical inferences. These atlases, represented in volumetric or surface coordinate spaces, can describe brain topology from a variety of perspectives. Although many human brain atlases have circulated the field over the past fifty years, limited effort has been devoted to their standardization. Standardization can facilitate consistency and transparency with respect to orientation, resolution, labeling scheme, file storage format, and coordinate space designation. Our group has worked to consolidate an extensive selection of popular human brain atlases into a single, curated, open-source library, where they are stored following a standardized protocol with accompanying metadata, which can serve as the basis for future atlases. The repository containing the atlases, the specification, as well as relevant transformation functions is available in the neuroparc {OSF} registered repository or

Its application to images containing many objects, such as images of the human abdomen, may prove to be very challenging. The underlying idea of our approach is to follow a strategy that resembles commonsense problem solving - goal-directed, context-based and focused. In our method, the goal of recognizing a particular anatomical structure, such as the aorta, is achieved by following a plan, which is a sequence of image registration tasks. The plan is derived by decomposing the registration of the goal object into a series of object registration subtasks using the anatomy knowledge and the modality-speciﬁc image properties. Preliminary experiments to recognize the aorta in human abdominal {CT} images have demonstrated the potential of our method.},

In this study, we demonstrate how whole-brain {GMACs} can be generated from conventional structural connectome methodology, describing each step in detail, as well as providing tools to allow for the calculation of {GMAC}. To illustrate the utility of {GMAC}, we demonstrate the relationship between age and gray matter connectivity, using voxel-based analyses of {GMAC}.

            The relationship between structural and functional connectivity in the brain is a key question in systems neuroscience. Modern accounts assume a single global structure-function relationship that persists over time. Here we study structure-function coupling from a dynamic perspective, and show that it is regionally heterogeneous. We use a temporal unwrapping procedure to identify moment-to-moment co-fluctuations in neural activity, and reconstruct time-resolved structure-function coupling patterns. We find that patterns of dynamic structure-function coupling are region-specific. We observe stable coupling in unimodal and transmodal cortex, and dynamic coupling in intermediate regions, particularly in insular cortex (salience network) and frontal eye fields (dorsal attention network). Finally, we show that the variability of a region’s structure-function coupling is related to the distribution of its connection lengths. Collectively, our findings provide a way to study structure-function relationships from a dynamic perspective.},

Additionally, individual differences in high-order cognitive abilities were significantly correlated with the specificity of {TMS} propagation patterns across {DAN} and {DMN}, but not with resting-state {EEG} dynamics.

These connection patterns are believed to support cognitive processes and, when compromised, can lead to neurocognitive deﬁcits and maladaptive behavior. A powerful approach for studying the organizing principles of brain networks is to construct group-representative networks from multisubject cohorts. Doing so ampliﬁes signal to noise ratios and provides a clearer picture of brain network organization. Here, we show that current approaches for generating sparse group-representative networks overestimate the proportion of short-range connections present in a network and, as a result, fail to match subject-level networks along a wide range of network statistics. We present an alternative approach that preserves the connection-length distribution of individual subjects. We have used this method in previous papers to generate group-representative networks, though to date its performance has not been appropriately benchmarked and compared against other methods. As a result of this simple modiﬁcation, the networks generated using this approach successfully recapitulate subject-level properties, outperforming similar approaches by better preserving features that promote integrative brain function rather than segregative. The method developed here holds promise for future studies investigating basic organizational principles and features of large-scale structural brain networks.},

Our analyses revealed an anatomical gradient of excitability across the cortex, with stronger {iES}-evoked {EEG} responses in high-order compared to low-order regions. Mathematical modeling further showed that this variation in excitability levels results from a differential dependence of recurrent feedback from non-stimulated regions across the anatomical hierarchy, and could be extinguished by suppressing those connections in-silico. High-order brain regions/networks thus show a more functionally integrated processing style than low-order ones, which manifests as a spatial gradient of excitability that is emergent from, and causally dependent on, the underlying hierarchical network structure.},

In this review article, we first present evidence for the predictability of brain activity from structural connectivity (i.e., white matter connections) and functional connectivity (i.e., temporally synchronized task-free activations). We then discuss the implications of such predictions to clinical populations, such as patients diagnosed with psychiatric disorders or neurologic diseases, and to the study of brain–behavior associations. We conclude that connectivity may serve as an infrastructure that dictates brain activity, and we pinpoint several open questions and directions for future research.},

Despite this remarkable difference with other cortical areas, the influence of motor output and its amplitude on {TEPs} is largely unknown. Here we studied {TEPs} resulting from M1 stimulation and assessed whether their waveform and spectral features depend on the {MEP} amplitude. To this aim, we performed two separate experiments. In experiment 1, single-pulse {TMS} was applied at the same supra-threshold intensity on primary motor, prefrontal, premotor and parietal cortices and the corresponding {TEPs} were compared by means of local mean field power and time-frequency spectral analysis. In experiment 2 we stimulated M1 at resting motor threshold in order to elicit {MEPs} characterized by a wide range of amplitudes. {TEPs} computed from high-{MEP} and low-{MEP} trials were then compared using the same methods applied in experiment 1. In line with previous studies, {TMS} of M1 produced larger {TEPs} compared to other cortical stimulations. Notably, we found that only {TEPs} produced by M1 stimulation were accompanied by a late event-related desynchronization ({ERD}—peaking at {\textasciitilde}300 ms after {TMS}), whose magnitude was strongly dependent on the amplitude of {MEPs}. Overall, these results suggest that M1 produces peculiar responses to {TMS} possibly reflecting specific anatomo-functional properties, such as the re-entry of proprioceptive feedback associated with target muscle activation.},

Studies that focus on brain connectivity have the aim of understanding and modeling brain function, taking into account the spatiotemporal dynamics of neural communication between brain regions. Much of the current knowledge regarding brain connectivity has been obtained from stand-alone neuroimaging methods. Nevertheless, the use of a multimodal approach seems to be a powerful way to investigate effective brain connectivity, overcoming the limitations of unimodal approaches. In this review, we will present the advantages of an integrative approach in which transcranial magnetic stimulation–electroencephalography coregistration is combined with magnetic resonance imaging methods to explore effective neural interactions. Moreover, we will describe possible implementations of the integrative approach in open- and closed-loop frameworks where real-time brain activity becomes a contributor to the study of cognitive brain networks.},

	abstract = {A compelling way to disentangle the complexity of the brain is to measure the effects of spatially and temporally synchronized systematic perturbations. In humans, this can be non-­invasively achieved by combining transcranial magnetic stimulation ({TMS}) and electroencephalography ({EEG}). Spatiotemporally complex and long-l­asting {TMS}-E­ {EG} evoked potential ({TEP}) waveforms are believed to result from recurrent, re-­entrant activity that propagates broadly across multiple cortical and subcortical regions, dispersing from and later re-­converging on, the primary stimulation site. However, if we loosely understand the {TEP} of a {TMS}-­stimulated region as the impulse response function of a noisy underdamped harmonic oscillator, then multiple later activity components (waveform peaks) should be expected even for an isolated network node in the complete absence of recurrent inputs. Thus emerges a critically important question for basic and clinical research on human brain dynamics: what parts of the {TEP} are due to purely local dynamics, what parts are due to reverberant, re-­entrant network activity, and how can we distinguish between the two? To disentangle this, we used source-­localized {TMS}-E­ {EG} analyses and whole-­brain connectome-­based computational modelling. Results indicated that recurrent network feedback begins to drive {TEP} responses from 100 ms post-­stimulation, with earlier {TEP} components being attributable to local reverberatory activity within the stimulated region. Subject-­specific estimation of neurophysiological parameters additionally indicated an important role for inhibitory {GABAergic} neural populations in scaling cortical excitability levels, as reflected in {TEP} waveform characteristics. The novel discoveries and new software technologies introduced here should be of broad utility in basic and clinical neuroscience research.},

Despite their popularity and widespread use, there are a number of practical considerations that must be taken into account in order to increase the robustness of streamlines tracking results, particularly when these methods are used to study brain structural connectivity, and the connectome. This review article describes what we consider the ‘seven deadly sins’ of mapping structural connections using diﬀusion {MRI} streamlines ﬁbre-tracking, with particular emphasis on ‘sins’ that can be practically avoided and they can have an important impact in the results. It is shown that there are important ‘deadly sins’ to be avoided at every step of the pipeline, such as during data acquisition, during data modelling to estimate local ﬁbre architecture, during the ﬁbre-tracking process itself, and during quantiﬁcation of the tracking results. The recommendations here are intended to inform users on potential important shortcomings of their current tracking protocols, as well as to guide future users on some of the key issues and decisions that must be faced when designing their processing pipelines.},

            The human brain represents a complex computational system, the function and structure of which may be measured using various neuroimaging techniques focusing on separate properties of the brain tissue and activity. We capture the organization of white matter fibers acquired by diffusion-weighted imaging using probabilistic diffusion tractography. By segmenting the results of tractography into larger anatomical units, it is possible to draw inferences about the structural relationships between these parts of the system. This pipeline results in a structural connectivity matrix, which contains an estimate of connection strength among all regions. However, raw data processing is complex, computationally intensive, and requires expert quality control, which may be discouraging for researchers with less experience in the field. We thus provide brain structural connectivity matrices in a form ready for modelling and analysis and thus usable by a wide community of scientists. The presented dataset contains brain structural connectivity matrices together with the underlying raw diffusion and structural data, as well as basic demographic data of 88 healthy subjects.},

We find that structure-function coupling is hetero­ geneous across brain regions and frequency bands. The link between structural and functional connectivity is generally stronger in multiple {MEG} frequency bands compared to resting state {fMRI}. Structure-function coupling is greater in slower and intermediate frequency bands compared to faster frequency bands. We also find that structure-function coupling systematically follows the archetypal sensorimotor-association hierarchy, as well as patterns of laminar differentiation, peaking in granular layer {IV}. Finally, structure-function coupling is better explained using structure-informed inter-regional communication metrics than using structural connectivity alone. Collectively, these results place neurophysiological and haemodynamic structure-function relationships in a common frame of reference and provide a starting point for a multi-modal understanding of structure-function coupling in the brain.},

            Combining Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ({TMS}) with electroencephalography ({EEG}) offers the opportunity to study signal propagation dynamics at high temporal resolution in the human brain. {TMS} pulse induces a local effect which propagates across cortical networks engaging distant cortical and subcortical sites. However, the degree of propagation supported by the structural compared to functional connectome remains unclear. Clarifying this issue would help tailor {TMS} interventions to maximize target engagement. The goal of this study was to establish the contribution of functional and structural connectivity in predicting {TMSinduced}
signal propagation after perturbation of two distinct brain networks. For this purpose,
24 healthy individuals underwent two identical {TMS}-{EEG} visits where neuronavigated {TMS} pulses were delivered to nodes of the default mode network ({DMN}) and the dorsal attention network ({DAN}). The functional and structural connectivity derived from each individual stimulation spot were characterized via functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) and Diffusion Weighted Imaging ({DWI}), and signal propagation across these two metrics was compared. Direct comparison between the signal extracted from brain regions either functionally or structurally connected to the stimulation sites, shows a stronger activation over
cortical areas connected via white matter pathways, with a minor contribution of functional projections. This pattern was not observed when analyzing spontaneous resting state {EEG} activity. Overall, results suggest that structural links can predict network-level response to perturbation more accurately than functional connectivity. Additionally, {DWI}-based estimation of propagation patterns can be used to estimate off-target engagement of other networks and possibly guide target selection to maximize specificity.},

            Imaging technologies are increasingly used to generate high-resolution reference maps of brain structure and function. Comparing experimentally generated maps to these reference maps facilitates cross-disciplinary scientific discovery. Although recent data sharing initiatives increase the accessibility of brain maps, data are often shared in disparate coordinate systems, precluding systematic and accurate comparisons. Here we introduce neuromaps, a toolbox for accessing, transforming and analyzing structural and functional brain annotations. We implement functionalities for generating high-quality transformations between four standard coordinate systems. The toolbox includes curated reference maps and biological ontologies of the human brain, such as molecular, microstructural, electrophysiological, developmental and functional ontologies. Robust quantitative assessment of map-to-map similarity is enabled via a suite of spatial autocorrelation-preserving null models. neuromaps combines open-access data with transparent functionality for standardizing and comparing brain maps, providing a systematic workflow for comprehensive structural and functional annotation enrichment analysis of the human brain.},

Despite both being anaesthetics, propofol and ketamine produce different subjective states: we explore the different effects of these two anaesthetics on the structure of dynamic attractors reconstructed from electrophysiological activity recorded from cerebral cortex of two macaques. We used two methods: the first embeds the recordings in a continuous high-dimensional manifold on which we use topological data analysis to infer the presence of higher-order dynamics. The second reconstruction, an ordinal partition network embedding, allows us to create a discrete state-transition network, which is amenable to information-theoretic analysis and contains rich information about state-transition dynamics. We find that the awake condition generally had the ‘richest’ structure, visiting the most states, the presence of pronounced higher-order structures, and the least deterministic dynamics. By contrast, the propofol condition had the most dissimilar dynamics, transitioning to a more impoverished, constrained, low-structure regime. The ketamine condition, interestingly, seemed to combine aspects of both: while it was generally less complex than the awake condition, it remained well above propofol in almost all measures. These results provide deeper and more comprehensive insights than what is typically gained by using point-measures of complexity.},

We conducted a systematic literature search for {TMS}-{EEG} studies on human unconscious state using {PubMed} with cross-reference and manual searches. The initial search yielded 137 articles, and 19 of them were identified as relevant, including one article found by manual search. This review included 10 studies for unresponsive wakefulness syndrome ({UWS}), 9 for minimally conscious states ({MCS}), 5 for medication-induced unconscious states, and 6 for natural non-rapid eye movement states. These studies analyzed {TMS}-evoked potential to calculate perturbational complexity index ({PCI}) and {OFF}-periods. In particular, {PCI} was found to be a potentially useful marker to differentiate between {UWS} and {MCS}. This review demonstrated that {TMS}-{EEG} could represent a promising neuroscientific tool to investigate various unconscious states. Further {TMS}-{EEG} research may help elucidate the neural basis of unconscious state.},

            Prominent theories of consciousness emphasise different aspects of neurobiology, such as the integration and diversity of information processing within the brain. Here, we combine graph theory and dynamic functional connectivity to compare resting-state functional {MRI} data from awake volunteers, propofol-anaesthetised volunteers, and patients with disorders of consciousness, in order to identify consciousness-specific patterns of brain function. We demonstrate that cortical networks are especially affected by loss of consciousness during temporal states of high integration, exhibiting reduced functional diversity and compromised informational capacity, whereas thalamo-cortical functional disconnections emerge during states of higher segregation. Spatially, posterior regions of the brain’s default mode network exhibit reductions in both functional diversity and integration with the rest of the brain during unconsciousness. These results show that human consciousness relies on spatio-temporal interactions between brain integration and functional diversity, whose breakdown may represent a generalisable biomarker of loss of consciousness, with potential relevance for clinical practice.},

            Quantifying the Unquantifiable
            
              Manipulation of consciousness is an everyday medical trick—think anesthesia—but physicians have only the crudest of tools to detect when a person is not aware. The usual question or physical stimulus does not always provide reliable reactions, and a more precise index is needed to avoid, for example, the conclusion that people who have locked-in syndrome (in which they are aware but cannot respond) are unconscious. Here, Casali
              et al.
              have extended their previous work on electrical correlates of consciousness to define an electroencephalographic-derived index of human consciousness [the perturbational complexity index ({PCI})] that reflects the information content of the brain’s response to a magnetic stimulus. The {PCI} could allow tracking of consciousness in individual patients.
            
            The authors used data already collected from previous experiments, in which they had stimulated people’s brains with transcranial magnetic stimulation. By calculating the likely brain regional sources of the signals and then comparing the unique information in each, the authors derived {PCI} values. The values ranged from 0.44 to 0.67 in 32 awake healthy people, but fell to 0.18 to 0.28 during nonrapid eye movement ({NREM}) sleep. Then, to see whether a completely different way of inducing unconsciousness had the same effect on {PCI}, the authors assessed data from patients given various amounts of the anesthetics midazolam, xenon, and propofol. These agents too caused low “unconscious” values for the {PCI}: midazolam deep sedation, 0.23 to 0.31; propofol, 0.13 to 0.30; and xenon, 0.12 to 0.31.
            However, what about patients who suffer brain damage and who exhibit various levels of consciousness by conventional assessment methods? In these people, consciousness varies widely, as does the underlying damage from stroke or trauma. Here, too, the authors found promising results in those who had emerged from coma but were in a vegetative state or minimally conscious state, or exhibited locked-in syndrome. The {PCI} values from these patients clearly reflected the state of their consciousness, with the six patients in a vegetative state clearly unconscious (0.19 to 0.31), the two with locked-in syndrome clearly aware (0.51 to 0.62), and those in a minimally conscious state showing intermediate values (0.32 to 0.49).
            
              The validity of {PCI} for clinical application will need to be assessed in prospective trials, but it has the advantage of being derived from a simple noninvasive measurement. The new index reported by Casali
              et al.
              appears to be a robust measure that distinguishes conscious from unconscious states well enough to be used on an individual basis, a prerequisite for deployment in the clinic.
            
          , 
            One challenging aspect of the clinical assessment of brain-injured, unresponsive patients is the lack of an objective measure of consciousness that is independent of the subject’s ability to interact with the external environment. Theoretical considerations suggest that consciousness depends on the brain’s ability to support complex activity patterns that are, at once, distributed among interacting cortical areas (integrated) and differentiated in space and time (information-rich). We introduce and test a theory-driven index of the level of consciousness called the perturbational complexity index ({PCI}). {PCI} is calculated by (i) perturbing the cortex with transcranial magnetic stimulation ({TMS}) to engage distributed interactions in the brain (integration) and (ii) compressing the spatiotemporal pattern of these electrocortical responses to measure their algorithmic complexity (information). We test {PCI} on a large data set of {TMS}-evoked potentials recorded in healthy subjects during wakefulness, dreaming, nonrapid eye movement sleep, and different levels of sedation induced by anesthetic agents (midazolam, xenon, and propofol), as well as in patients who had emerged from coma (vegetative state, minimally conscious state, and locked-in syndrome). {PCI} reliably discriminated the level of consciousness in single individuals during wakefulness, sleep, and anesthesia, as well as in patients who had emerged from coma and recovered a minimal level of consciousness. {PCI} can potentially be used for objective determination of the level of consciousness at the bedside.},

              {FC}
              ) states on a slow timescale of the order of tens of seconds. While the phenomenology of the resting state dynamics is valuable in distinguishing healthy and pathologic brains, little is known about its underlying mechanisms. Here, we identify neuronal cascades as a potential mechanism. Using full-brain network modeling, we show that neuronal populations, coupled via a detailed structural connectome, give rise to large-scale cascades of firing rate fluctuations evolving at the same time scale of resting-state networks (
              {RSNs}
              ). The ignition and subsequent propagation of cascades depend on the brain state and connectivity of each region. The largest cascades produce bursts of blood oxygen level-dependent ({BOLD}) co-fluctuations at pairs of regions across the brain, which shape the simulated
              {RSN}

	abstract = {Neural bases of consciousness have been explored through many different paradigms and the notion of complexity emerged as a unifying framework to characterize conscious experience. To date, the perturbational complexity index ({PCI}), rooted on information theory, shows high performance in assessing consciousness. However, the mechanisms underpinning this perturbational complexity remain unclear as well as its counterpart in spontaneous activity. In the present study, we explore brain responsiveness and resting-state activity through largescale brain modeling and prove that complexity and consciousness are directly associated with a fluid dynamical regime. This fluidity is reflected in the dynamic functional connectivity, and other metrics drawn from dynamical systems theory and manifolds can capture such dynamics in synthetic data. We then validate our findings on a cohort of 15 subjects under anesthesia and wakefulness and show that measures of fluidity on spontaneous activity can distinguish consciousness in agreement with perturbational complexity.},

Such a parametric simulator is equipped with a stochastic generative process, which itself provides the basis for inference and prediction of the local and global brain dynamics affected by disorders. However, the calculation of likelihood function at whole-brain scale is often intractable. Thus, likelihood-free algorithms are required to efficiently estimate the parameters pertaining to the hypothetical areas, ideally including the uncertainty. In this study, we introduce the simulation-based inference for the virtual epileptic patient model ({SBI}-{VEP}), enabling us to amortize the approximate posterior of the generative process from a low-dimensional representation of whole-brain epileptic patterns. The state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms for conditional density estimation are used to readily retrieve the statistical relationships between parameters and observations through a sequence of invertible transformations. We show that the {SBI}-{VEP} is able to efficiently estimate the posterior distribution of parameters linked to the extent of the epileptogenic and propagation zones from sparse intracranial electroencephalography recordings. The presented Bayesian methodology can deal with non-linear latent dynamics and parameter degeneracy, paving the way for fast and reliable inference on brain disorders from neuroimaging modalities.},

Instead of preserving spatial information and collapsing across time, network analysis of time series does the reverse: it collapses spatial information, instead preserving temporally extended dynamics, typically corresponding to evolution through some kind of phase/state-space. This allows researchers to infer a, possibly low-dimensional, “intrinsic manifold” from empirical brain data. We will discuss three methods of constructing networks from nonlinear time series, and how to interpret them in the context of neural data: recurrence networks, visibility networks, and ordinal partition networks. By capturing typically continuous, non-linear dynamics in the form of discrete networks, we show how techniques from network science, non-linear dynamics, and information theory can extract meaningful information distinct from what is normally accessible in standard network neuroscience approaches.},

            An avalanche or cascade occurs when one event causes one or more subsequent events, which in turn may cause further events in a chain reaction. Avalanching dynamics are studied in many disciplines, with a recent focus on average avalanche shapes, i.e., the temporal profiles of avalanches of fixed duration. At the critical point of the dynamics, the rescaled average avalanche shapes for different durations collapse onto a single universal curve. We apply Markov branching process theory to derive an equation governing the average avalanche shape for cascade dynamics on networks. Analysis of the equation at criticality demonstrates that nonsymmetric average avalanche shapes (as observed in some experiments) occur for certain combinations of dynamics and network topology. We give examples using numerical simulations of models for information spreading, neural dynamics, and behavior adoption and we propose simple experimental tests to quantify whether cascading systems are in the critical state.},
